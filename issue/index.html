  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

  <p>This issue is proposing a new design for the default frontend theme for
    Drupal 9 (targeted for inclusion in Drupal 9.1). Note this is separate from
    the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3079738">new
      administration theme, Claro</a>, which was just committed to core several
    days ago.</p>

  <p>This new frontend theme will have a modern look and feel based on adjectives
    and principles that were identified during the design process (more on this
    below). It will be <a
      href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag">WCAG AA compliant</a>, support
    updated functionality in Drupal, and is intended to feel modern going into the
    future. The theme is named ‚ÄúOlivero‚Äù after <a
      href="https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/community-spotlight/2019-02-22/remembering-rachel-olivero">Rachel
      Olivero</a>, who was an advocate for accessibility and a Drupal community
    member (more on that below).</p>

  <h2 id="need">Need</h2>

  <p>The design of the current default theme (<a
      href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/themes/bartik-theme">Bartik</a>)
    has not changed since the release of Drupal 7 in January of 2011. While Bartik
    has proved itself to be versatile over the years, its design has aged with the
    years and fails to showcase Drupal‚Äôs state-of-the-art power and functionality.
  </p>

  <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Updated modern design:</strong> Our intention is to design a theme
      that feels modern and ages well. Design elements such as drop shadows, and
      gradients are used sparingly while typography, animation and color palettes
      have been thought out.</li>

    <li><strong>Functionality that supports new features:</strong> We want the
      theme to include support for recent commonly used Drupal functionality such
      as second-level navigation, embedded media, layout builder, and more.</li>

    <li><strong>WCAG AA Compliance:</strong> The theme will be WCAG AA compliant.
      We will be working closely with accessibility experts and the Drupal
      Accessibility team to ensure that the theme passes <a
        href="https://www.drupal.org/node/464500">Drupal‚Äôs stringent accessibility standards</a> with
      flying colors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will work with the community to help ensure that the new theme is aligned
    with the above goals in order to create a successful theme.</p>

  <h2 id="designprocess">Design Process</h2>

  <p>The first step was to solicit community feedback within the Drupal Core ideas
    queue: [#3064880]. This issue confirmed that the idea to add a new theme is
    sought after by the community.</p>

  <h3 id="initialstakeholders">Initial Stakeholders</h3>

  <p>Once we knew our idea was valid and sought after by the community, we moved
    to identify the stakeholders for the design process that we deemed essential
    for the theme to be successful, and to help guide us throughout the process.
    The following community members were identified:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/dries">Dries Buytaert</a>: Creator and
      project lead for Drupal</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick">Ang</a><a
        href="https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick">ie</a> <a
        href="https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick">Byron</a>: Drupal core committer
      and product manager</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/lauriii">Lauri Eskola</a>: Drupal core
      committer and frontend framework manager</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/ckrina">Cristina Chumillas</a>: Drupal
      usability maintainer</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy">G</a><a
        href="https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy">√°</a><a
        href="https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy">bor Hojtsy</a>: Drupal
      core committer, product manager and initiative coordinator coordinator</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="firststepstakeholdersurvey">First step: Stakeholder Survey</h3>

  <p>During the research phase, we worked with stakeholders to identify adjectives
    to help guide the visual design. We created a sliding scale exercise <a
      href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uw0irdudq873qk1/sliding_scale.jpg?dl=0"></a>where
    stakeholders could add a points across several tone spectrums. Some of these
    were clearly one adjective or the other (‚ÄúFormal‚Äù not ‚ÄúCasual‚Äù) while others
    highlight the importance of a balance (‚ÄúApproachable‚Äù and ‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù).</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__sliding-scale.jpg" alt="Sliding Scale Survey showing various terms (Formal, casual) with dots placed between them." /></p>

  <h3 id="voiceandtoneofolivero">Voice and tone of Olivero</h3>

  <p>The below are keywords that were identified and will serve as the <em>voice
      and tone</em> of the new theme:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Formal</li>

    <li>Light &amp; Bright (vs dark &amp; impactful)</li>

    <li>Contemporary</li>

    <li>Approachable and Official</li>

    <li>Novel (with some constraint)</li>

    <li>Cool</li>

    <li>High contrast with some restraint</li>

    <li>Light (and not heavy)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="designprinciples">Design Principles</h3>

  <p>The following principles were established through research and collaboration,
    and are useful for guiding future additions and feedback for changes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> WCAG AA compliance is a top
      priority for the design. The layout, colors and functionality should provide
      an accessible theme that can be enjoyed by everyone.</li>

    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Avoid unnecessary visual elements, colors,
      effects, and complexity.</li>

    <li><strong>Modern:</strong> Take advantage of the capabilities and strengths
      of modern browsers and interaction patterns.</li>

    <li><strong>Focused:</strong> Embrace high contrast, saturated color, and
      negative space to draw the eye to what‚Äôs most important. Design defaults for
      the 80%.</li>

    <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Provide options and overrides to account for
      varied needs and preferences.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="themeetingfeedbackloop">The Meeting / Feedback Loop</h3>

  <p>Once the design principles and the voice &amp; tone were established, we then
    created 3 separate <a
      href="https://www.lullabot.com/articles/zoom-mocks-bridging-the-divide-between-styles-and-page-design">zoom
      mocks</a> to explore how those styles could apply to pages and components.
    These were then presented to the stakeholders, who choose a design to move
    forward with.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__3-choices.jpg" alt="3 designs for the new theme. Left one is more traditional, center is üòç, and the right one is kinda weird." /></p>

  <p>The chosen design was iterated upon, and once again brought in front of the
    stakeholders, who then provided additional feedback.</p>

  <p>The design process continued with the addition of internal accessibility
    testing, which highlighted several contrast deficiencies that were
    subsequently fixed.</p>

  <p>We then brought the designs to one of the Drupal core accessibility
    maintainers (thank you <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/rainbreaw">Rain</a>!)
    to validate accessibility, give additional accessibility feedback, and answer
    some lingering questions.</p>

  <h2 id="thedesignsystem">The Design System</h2>

  <p>The goal is to create a design system that helps provide efficiency and
    flexibility while empowering team members from varied disciplines to maintain,
    extend and iterate on the design of the theme into the future.</p>

  <p>Note that the design system is still a work in progress. We will continue to
    adapt and define the system to meet the needs of the community and software
    well into the development process.</p>

  <h3 id="responsivegrids">Responsive Grids</h3>

  <p>What follows are the rules and guidelines that define the responsive grid for
    the design system.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__grid.jpg" alt="Theme design with a uniform grid overlayed" /></p>

  <h3 id="verticalrhythm">Vertical Rhythm</h3>

  <p>"<a href="https://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm">Vertical
      Rhythm</a>" describes the visual rhythm of elements as a user scrolls down a
    page based on things like type size, line height and the margins between
    paragraphs and headings (and other page elements). We establish vertical
    rhythm by setting a target height for a VRU (vertical rhythm unit) and then
    leveraging that proportionally to guide things like line height, paragraph and
    heading margins, and sectional spacing. We also employ incremental leading
    when necessary to maintain the proper feel within varied type sizes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Throughout the design system, <strong>1 VRU = 9px</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="spacing">Spacing</h3>

  <p>Spacing such as padding and margin will be tied to the VRUs, and the grid
    system to help create a well balanced design that is predictable and easy to
    scale.</p>

  <h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>

  <p>Typography is based on a scale to help keep type sizing, line-height and
    spacing consistent throughout the design. The base font used for body copy is
    18px. From there, we created sizes for headers, metadata, quotations, and
    various ui elements. The font size is adjusted for smaller screen sizes.</p>

  <p>Fonts utilized in this design are licensed under <a
      href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=OFL_web">SIL
      Open font License 1.1</a>. This license is compatible with the <a
      href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1475972">Drupal.org distribution packaging
      requirements</a>.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__typography.jpg"
      alt="Typography for the design showing headings, etc" /></p>

  <h3 id="colorpalette">Color Palette</h3>

  <p>The color palette created uses a bright blue as a base color and introduces
    neutral grays to help balance out the layout and design elements. The colors
    chosen help create a modern, bright feel while also bringing in some of the
    Drupal branding. Darker colors were introduced to help with accessibility
    while lighter colors are used for supporting design elements throughout the
    layout.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__colors.jpg" alt="Colors used for the design" /></p>

  <h3 id="uipatterns">UI Patterns</h3>

  <p><strong>Header &amp; Navigation</strong>
    The header has been designed to accommodate the versatility of text titles or
    logos. Different versions of the header will display depending on what the
    user chooses to enable as their site identity (more on this below).</p>

  <p>On scroll down, the header will collapse into a hamburger-button menu,
    allowing the user to always be able to access the menu on longer pages.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__desktop-nav.jpg"
      alt="Desktop nav collapsing into a button when scrolled down. Also shows menu is open after button is clicked." />
  </p>

  <p>The theme will have an option toggle to turn on hamburger-button based
    navigation at wide widths. This will be useful in the case where the website
    has many long first-level navigation items.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero-desktop-hamburger.jpg"
      alt="Theme at wide widths showing button menu" /></p>

  <p><img src="olivero-desktop-hamburger--open.jpg"
      alt="Theme at wide widths showing button menu open" /></p>

  <p>Olivero will also support secondary dropdown menus!</p>

  <p><img src="olivero-drop-menu.jpg"
      alt="Theme showing dropdown secondary menu" /></p>

  <p><strong>Site branding variations</strong></p>

  <p>Theme settings will exist to change the background-color and width (if
    necessary) of the site-branding to support a wide range of logos and long
    text.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__site-branding-white.jpg"
      alt="Site branding block variation with white background" /></p>

  <p><img src="olivero__site-branding-gray.jpg"
      alt="Site branding block variation with gray background" /></p>

  <p><img src="olivero__site-branding-logo.jpg"
      alt="Site branding block variation with logo" /></p>

  <p><img src="olivero__site-branding-gray-logo.jpg"
      alt="Site branding block variation gray with logo" /></p>

  <p><img src="olivero__site-branding-blue-logo.jpg"
      alt="Site branding block variation blue with logo" /></p>

  <p><strong>Buttons</strong>
    The goal for buttons is for users to easily recognize a clickable action. For
    the theme, we designed a primary button style that‚Äôs filled, and a secondary
    button style that‚Äôs an outlined version of the button.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__buttons.jpg"
      alt="Button variations and states. Focus states have extra outline." /></p>

  <p><strong>Forms</strong>
    Form inputs are kept simple, yet modern. The goal is to have form elements
    feel part of the design, while still being recognizable, usable and
    accessible. The left color bar signals the form element, and labels are placed
    above the form field to help avoid any confusion. Form fields all have a
    similar look to help establish that they are a form element. States such as
    focus, disabled and errors have also been accounted for.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__forms.jpg"
      alt="Form element styles showing variations and states. Text variations have extra left border." />
  </p>

  <p><strong>Tables</strong>
    Table divider lines are kept at a minimum to help with readability. The theme
    will support responsive table features of Drupal.</p>

  <p><strong>Sidebar</strong>
    The new default theme supports a single sidebar region that allows content
    creators to showcase related posts and other types of utility blocks. This
    region will float next to the primary content. We eliminate the previous
    adaptation of having two sidebars so that the content stands out in a rich and
    meaningful way without having to compete for space.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__sidebar.jpg"
      alt="Sidebar floating to the right of the body text" /></p>

  <p><strong>RTL Support</strong>
    The theme will fully support right-to-left languages as required by Drupal
    core.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__rtl.jpg"
      alt="Design is flipped with a right to left language (showing arabic)." /></p>

  <p><strong>Messages</strong>
    Messages are used to inform the user of an action that they may need to take,
    important information that they may need to know, or provide feedback on an
    action already taken. Messages are clear and easily notable. Messages have
    been designed in a way where bright color is used to highlight the message,
    but doesn‚Äôt interfere with the readability of the message itself. Icons are
    used to support the type of message that the theme is displaying.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__messages.jpg"
      alt="Messages block variations have a gray background and icon. They are dismissable." />
  </p>

  <p><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong>
    The placement of breadcrumbs near the top of the page above the page title is
    a familiar location where users can instantly identify them as breadcrumbs.
    Breadcrumb links will be displayed in the link color used throughout the
    design. On smaller devices, breadcrumbs will displayed left to right or right
    to left, spilling off the edge of the screen. A visual cue will let users know
    that there‚Äôs more breadcrumbs to see, and they can access those breadcrumbs by
    swiping left to right or right to left.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__breadcrumbs.jpg"
      alt="Breadcrumb links at desktop. There's a border bottom, and they are separated by chevrons." />
  </p>

  <p>At smaller widths, the breadcrumbs will have a horizontal overflow scroll
    functionality if the length goes beyond the width of its container. This is a
    common approach for providing access to the full breadcrumb trail on narrow
    screens.</p>

  <p><img src="olivero__breadcrumbs--small.jpg"
      alt="Breadcrumbs at small widths. Text is cut off with indicator showing that it is horizontally scrollable." />
  </p>

  <h2 id="whatwillnotmakemvp">What will not make MVP</h2>

  <p>We will not be supporting the Color module within the initial release, but
    this or similar functionality may be included later. We‚Äôre tracking this as a
    feature request in [#3086514].</p>

  <h2 id="proofofconcepthtml">Proof of Concept HTML</h2>

  <p>Throughout the process, we‚Äôve been building a prototype in static HTML, CSS,
    and JavaScript. The intention of this is to validate the scroll / header
    interactions, and ensure they can be made accessible. In addition, we‚Äôre
    validating the use of CSS grid and overall front-end architecture to ensure it
    can be made to be accessible, as well as work with Internet Explorer 11 (as
    well as other core supported browsers).</p>

  <p>This proof of concept is not yet <em>fully</em> accessible, although it will
    eventually be made to be. At that point we plan on getting a full sign-off
    from the Drupal accessibility team, which will hopefully alleviate last minute
    time-crunches when the patch is submitted to Drupal core.</p>

  <p>The proof of concept is at <a href="https://olivero-poc.netlify.com">https://olivero-poc.netlify.com</a>, and the git
    repository for this is at <a href="https://github.com/Lullabot/olivero-poc">https://github.com/Lullabot/olivero-poc</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="themename">Theme Name</h2>

  <p>Drupal‚Äôs current theme, Bartik, was named after <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bartik">Jean Bartik</a>, one of the
    original programmers for the ENIAC computer. We wanted to continue in that
    spirit and name this theme after a pioneering female programmer. Earlier this
    year, <a
      href="https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/community-spotlight/2019-02-22/remembering-rachel-olivero">the
      Drupal community mourned the passing of Rachel Olivero</a>, and we have
    named this new theme in her honor. Rachel touched many people in both the
    Drupal and accessibility communities. She worked at the United States National
    Federation of the Blind and she was committed to making technology accessible
    to ALL people. We chose the name Olivero not just because we have made
    accessibility a top priority, but also because we aspire to develop this theme
    in our community in a manner that is consistent with the qualities that Rachel
    embodied, including patience, generosity, and inclusivity.</p>

  <h2 id="contributorstothedesign">Contributors to the design</h2>

  <p>Below is the initial team that worked through the designs (alphabetical)</p>

  <h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

  <p>Our team would love for this to be a wider community effort, and we welcome
    feedback and thoughts around the style and design system. We have worked
    iteratively with the stakeholders to come to this point, and will continue to
    work iteratively with the community to ensure that we complete the best theme
    possible for Drupal.</p>

  <p>We are especially looking for feedback related to the accessibility of the
    design, and we also want to ensure that the system is flexible with the
    capabilities of Drupal. This is a volunteer effort, and we will work hard to
    ensure all comments will be addressed in a thoughtful approach. You can <a
